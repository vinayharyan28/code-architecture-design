"""Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and managing memory resources for objects and data
structures within Python programs. Python, like Java, abstracts much of the low-level memory management tasks from
the programmer to provide a more user-friendly and secure environment. Here are the key aspects of memory management
in Python:
1. Automatic Memory Allocation: Python automatically allocates memory for objects when they are created.
You don't have to explicitly allocate or deallocate memory as you would in languages like C or C++. When you create
an object in Python, memory is allocated dynamically on the heap.

2. Reference Counting: Python uses a reference counting mechanism to keep track of how many references there are to
an object. Each object in Python has a reference count associated with it. When the reference count drops to zero,
the object becomes a candidate for automatic garbage collection.

3. Garbage Collection: Python has a built-in garbage collector that is responsible for reclaiming memory used by
objects that are no longer reachable or referenced by the program. This process helps prevent memory leaks. The
garbage collector periodically identifies and removes unreferenced objects, freeing up memory for reuse.

4. Cyclic Garbage Collection: In addition to reference counting, Python also employs cyclic garbage collection to
detect and collect objects involved in cyclic references (e.g., circular references among objects). This ensures that
even objects forming reference cycles are eventually collected.

5. Heap and Stack: Like Java, Python memory is divided into two main areas: the heap and the stack. The heap is used
for storing objects, while the stack is used for managing the execution of functions and local variables. Objects
live on the heap, and references to objects can be stored on the stack.

6. Object Lifecycle: Objects in Python go through various stages during their lifecycle, including creation,
referencing, de referencing, and garbage collection. Python keeps track of reference counts and uses this information
to manage the object lifecycle.

7. Automatic Memory Management: Python handles most memory management tasks, such as allocating memory for objects
and reclaiming memory when it's no longer needed. However, you can also use constructs like weak references to have
more control over how objects are managed in memory.

8. Memory Profiling: Python provides various tools and libraries for memory profiling, allowing you to monitor memory
usage and detect potential memory leaks in your applications.

In summary, memory management in Python is automatic and relies on reference counting and a garbage collector to
ensure efficient memory usage and prevent memory leaks. While you typically don't need to worry about memory
management details in Python, understanding how Python manages memory can help you write more efficient and reliable
code. The combination of reference counting and cyclic garbage collection helps Python handle memory management
effectively."""
