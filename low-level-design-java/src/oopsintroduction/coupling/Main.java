/**
 In software design, coupling refers to the degree of dependency between different modules or components within a system.
 Low coupling a desirable design principle because it promotes modularity, re-usability, and maintainability by reducing
 interdependence between different parts of the code.
 On the other hand, high coupling can make the code less flexible and harder to maintain because changes in one module
 may have ripple effects on other parts of the system.*/
